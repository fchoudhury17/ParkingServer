##Parking Server

Parking Server provides a platform for those looking to assign parking spots to employees, students, etc...
This platform allows users to complete a form, be placed in a queue that sends the person who is 1st in line to a following page that displays a parking lot where the user can proceed to choose from the available spots.

Queuing process aims to give priority to those who filled out the form first and gives users a specific time allotment to choose a spot to ensure the queue is not held up and continues to run smoothly.

Error messages include "Account under that email has already been created" and "Your session has expired."

Email sgupta17@kentdenver.org with any questions, concerns or ideas for future versions. Thanks!
